## What

* What policies should a business have and for what purpose?  (e.g. for GDPR, PCI, Physical and InfoSec, People etc.)
* Which ones are standard across any business? 
* Which ones would the community like to share and why? 
* How to make the policy more than just a document? Do you create it based on your business today or where you would like it to get to? We will discuss the pros and cons of both approaches.

## Outcomes
