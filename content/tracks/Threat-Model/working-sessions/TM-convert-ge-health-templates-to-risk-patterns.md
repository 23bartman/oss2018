description  : The team at GE-Health published MS Threat Modeling tool templates for IoT devices used in the health sector.  Convert these into Open Risk Pattern format.
locked       : true

## Why

The Medical Device threat modeling template for the MS Threat Modeling tool is created by GE Healthcare and published here under a liberal OS license: https://github.com/jpschaaf/threat-modeling-templates/blob/master/MedicalDeviceTemplate.tb7 
Converting it to an editable risk pattern format will achieve the following:
- It will be easier to use the template outside the MS tool (e.g. in a document or spreadsheet)
- It will be possible to expand recommended countermeasures list
- It will be possible to support change review of smaller changes to the file


## What

Review the differences between what is provided in the MS templates and the format for Risk Patterns defined on Tuesday.
Go through the GE-Health templates and provide the additional information required.  The templates already contain components, applicability criteria and threats, and sometimes recommended countermeasures.
The recommended countermeasures are likely to be the biggest gap.
(Note to organizer, please schedule as last session of day so that GE-Health team from Seattle can attend remotely)

## Outcomes

A set of risk patterns built on the content already provided by GE Healthcare in the Medical Device threat modeling template.
