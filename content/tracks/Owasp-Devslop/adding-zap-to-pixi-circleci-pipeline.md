description  : Adding OWASP ZAP to Pixi CircleCI pipeline

## Topic

In this working-session we will extend the Continuous Integration pipeline we know from the user-session https://owaspsummit.org/tracks/owasp-devslop/adding-crs3-pixi-to-circleci-pipeline/ with OWASP Zed Attack Proxy.

## Why

We want to enhance the security tests by adding automated ZAP tests of Pixi. We from the DevSlop project have problems to properly integrate ZAP in our CircleCI pipeline. ZAP does not find the vulnerabilites. We need some help here.

## What

We want to add automated ZAP tests in the CircleCI pipeline with ZAP Docker Container with your help.

## Outcomes

 - Added ZAP in CircleCI pipeline
 - See benefit of CRS3 in front of Pixi

## Who

 - DevOps
 - DevSecOps
 - Web Application Firewall
 - ModSecurity and OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set
 - ZAP
