description  : Extending the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set 3 and Pixi CircleCI pipeline
---

## Topic

In this working-session we will extend the Continuous Integration pipeline we know from the user-session https://owaspsummit.org/tracks/owasp-devslop/adding-crs3-pixi-to-circleci-pipeline/.

## Why

 - The more tests, the better :)
 - Testing the coverage of OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set
 - Proof of concept application tests of the known vulnerabilities in Pixi

## What

We want to cover the attacks of the known vulnerabilities in Pixi with the application tests and see if OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set 3 catches them!

## Outcomes

 - Tests to attack the vulnerabilities of Pixi
 - GitHub Core Rule Set project issues if needed

## Who

 - DevOps
 - DevSecOps
 - Web Application Firewall
 - ModSecurity and OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set
